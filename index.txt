<p>5. Function as a Service (FaaS): FaaS, also known as serverless computing, allows users to run individual functions or pieces of code in response to specific events without managing the infrastructure.</p>
<li>3 Benefits</li>
<p>Faster time to market -
You can spin up new instances or retire them in seconds, allowing developers to accelerate development with quick deployments. Cloud computing supports new innovations by making it easy to test new ideas and design new applications without hardware limitations or slow procurement processes.</p>
<p>2.Scalability and flexibility
Cloud computing gives your business more flexibility. You can quickly scale resources and storage up to meet business demands without having to invest in physical infrastructure.
Companies don’t need to pay for or build the infrastructure needed to support their highest load levels. Likewise, they can quickly scale down if resources aren’t being used.  </p>
<p> 3.Cost savings
Whatever cloud service model you choose, you only pay for the resources you actually use. This helps you avoid overbuilding and overprovisioning your data center and gives your IT teams back valuable time to focus on more strategic work. </p>
<li>3 Challenges</li>
<p>Resource Sprawl: As companies scale, there’s a tendency to over-provision, leading to wasted resources and inflated costs.</p>
